# simple-login
A simple login/register page made from PHP
Here's a very basic example of PHP code to allow users to register and login using a MySQL database:

Assuming you have a MySQL database with a "users" table containing columns "id" (auto-incrementing integer), "username" (varchar), "password" (varchar).
So consider that you should create this table on your database and write your connection variables on file: 'register_process' line 7 and 'login_process' line 7
